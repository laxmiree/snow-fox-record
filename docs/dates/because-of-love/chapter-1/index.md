- I'd really appreciate it if you could check out the YouTube video—the dubbing and BGM choice are just perfect accompaniment to the tears. And no need to head back to Tumblr for the T/N this time since I've added them directly into the video!

> **Lucien:** You will encounter your luckiest day of the year this month.

> **Lucien:** _\[his expression turns into a smile]_ .....When you feel that a certain action needs extra good luck and support, please heed the voice of your heart and enjoy the energy of the universe.

Withdrawing his gaze from the phone screen, Lucien looks toward me with a smile.

> **Lucien:** _\[chuckles]_ Looks like our answers are the same.

> **MC:** …Really? So **magical**!¹

I delightfully hold my phone and move closer. The two connected screens clearly display the same deck of cards with the same guiding words.

Lately, several colleagues at the company have been keen on looking into metaphysics, so I pulled Lucien along to have some fun after dinner today.

Even though I know I should regard public fortune-telling with rationality, the "mutual understanding" born out of random probability still brings a sweet delight to my heart.

I shift into a more comfortable position and nestle up to his side, even shaking my head in satisfaction.

> **Lucien:** _\[chuckles]_ Does this make you so happy?

> **MC:** Because it's a coincidence, it's very easy for this kind of just-right sense of destiny to hit you right in the heart\~

> **Lucien:** Then I'd rather understand it this way. It's because we're becoming more and more alike now that we've made the same choice.

> **Lucien:** Rather than fate's arrangement, I'd rather attribute it to you.

> **MC:** Professor Xu's 'theory' indeed sounds more reasonable, I especially resonate with it\~

I smile as I rest my head against his shoulder, my fingertip unconsciously tapping at the screen.

> **MC:** _\[smiles softly]_ But no matter how I look at it, this set of cards is just too perfect. It kinda feels like I've already been hit by good luck, and that just makes me look forward to it even more.

Lucien lets out a thoughtful 'mm', but it doesn’t feel like a response. I turn my head in puzzlement, seeing him looking back at the text on the screen as if he's scrutinizing it.

I just made a casual remark, this person wouldn't actually be seriously studying it now, would he?

> **MC:** Lucien, I...

A sudden kiss completely devours the words I haven't yet spoken.

His broad palm cradles the back of my head, pulling my lost balance back into his arms.

Our pressed skin stirs up a faint, restless heat, and his unbroken kisses surge like the tide, leaving me only fleeting moments to catch my breath.

It isn't until it suddenly starts raining outside, its soft patter mixing with the hum of the air conditioner, that he finally puts some distance between us.

Rainwater covers the condensation on the windows once again, a scene that seems to repeat countless times throughout this rainy season.

As if he notices that I am about to 'call him out'², Lucien innocently blinks his eyes and taps on the screen with righteous confidence, bringing up the previous page—

_"Don't be stingy in expressing your love to your partner._"

> **Lucien:** I just wanted to experience the feeling of being struck by good luck too.

> **MC:** Pfft, now you're the one getting superstitious.

> **Lucien:** After all, I also have things I want to look forward to.

As we chat, the phone screen dims, and only the heart-shaped lamp on the bookshelf remains lit, blending the two of us curled up on the sofa into its dreamy, romantic glow.

As the rain beats noisily, I suddenly feel like teasing him and brush my foot lightly against his.

> **MC:** But Professor Xu, we're facing a real-world problem right now.

> **MC:** According to the card reading, to enjoy the energy of the universe, we need to experience nature and soak up plenty of sunshine.

> **MC:** But the weather forecast says it’ll be rainy in Loveland City for the next few weeks, so what can we do?

> **Lucien:** Maybe we could make a few teru teru bozu³ and hang them up?

<figure><img src="https://www.notion.so/signed/attachment%3A0d162bd1-7a67-4cea-b6ed-25345d6c091b%3A1000156178.jpg?table=block&#x26;id=22e178eb-102d-8092-a586-fe94f5adf799&#x26;spaceId=263178eb-102d-819c-b0df-000335d01a5e&#x26;name=1000156178.jpg&#x26;userId=217d872b-594c-81c4-9088-000240bda7f5&#x26;cache=v2" alt="" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

When he finishes speaking, he starts laughing first, which makes me laugh too as I cup his face in my hands and gently knead it.

> **MC:** It’s over. All the rationality and logic of my great scientist have slipped away. That won't do, I've got to catch them and bring them back.

> **Lucien:** Just let them go.

Lucien takes the opportunity to hold my hand and pulls me down onto the sofa, wrapping me fully in his embrace.

> **Lucien:** Right now, all I want is to have a sweet dream with you.

As he speaks, he tightens his arms around me, making me nestle my head even more snugly against his chest.

In my haze, I hear Lucien speak.

> **Lucien:** MC, your anticipation won’t be in vain.

> **Lucien:** Though I don't know what exactly will happen then, I believe the entire universe will come to help you.

> **Lucien:** And when that time comes, do remember to give me good luck and support too.

:::info 📝 **[Translation Notes and Insights]**

- **¹:** **神奇** (shén qí) is the key term of this story; it is a two-character compound word made up of two words: 神 (shén – literally “god” or “divine”) and 奇 (qí – literally “strange,” “rare,” “unusual”).  
  It refers not just to unexpected phenomena, but to events and maybe even presence that feel uncannily perfect, fated, or deeply moving, almost as if the universe has ✨aligned✨ just for you.  
  In this translation, I will translate 神奇 as words like *magical*, *wondrous*, or *miraculous*, depending on the context, and I will bold the word wherever it appears to emphasize its thematic significance.

- **²:** The idiom used for that description is 兴师问罪 (xīng shī wèn zuì), which literally means “to mobilize troops to question a crime.” 兴师 refers to raising an army, while 问罪 means to hold someone accountable for wrongdoing.  
  Compared to just accusing someone, it’s more dramatic and carries a sense of righteous authority LOL. Here, it’s used playfully as she’s about to *pretend* to make a big deal and confront Lucien for kissing her without warning~

- **³:** “Teru teru bozu” (てるてる坊主), known in Chinese as **晴天娃娃** (qíng tiān wá wa — literally “sunny-day doll”), is a small handmade doll crafted from white cloth or paper and hung by windows to pray for sunny skies.  
  For someone like Lucien, who typically relies on data and logic, his willingness to hang one not only shows the care he puts into preparing even the smallest details beyond rationality for her happiness, but also reveals a growing, softer side of him that’s learning to embrace wonder and hope, no matter how irrational it may seem 🥺

It’s a reward from a general event, but I just had to mention it—
